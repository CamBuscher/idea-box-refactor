# idea-box Refactor

For our second module prework we were assigned the task of refactoring this project from the first module. 

The functionality on this version is nearly the exact same, but I changed the way my list items were stored. For the first mod my partner and I found a good way to work the project by storing (instead of each item as an individual object) one long string of HTML.

Everything was completely functional, but for the sake of long-term usability it wasn't practical. So I retooled the entire application to store objects individually in local storage, rather than that long, cumbersome HTML string.

This way the code is more manageable and more responsive to a design pivot or what have you. 

It didn't take too long, and I was glad for the javascript practice over this break.
